What it does
====================

Copy Utility only for text. 
When no range selected on page, Alt-c copy with template composedof url, title, or so. 
Also, we can copy from Toolbar icon. We can edit templates in options page.

For each 'Alt-c' key, copy text to clipboard. Text is constructed with one of the templates for URL-matched website.
And after Alt-c key, choice of template is shift to next. Next Alt-c means 'copying with other template and shift'.
Toolbar icon tell 'copy is fired' and 'next index of template'.
Also, clicking toolbar icon shows the list of template, and clicking template-name button go 'start copying'.
